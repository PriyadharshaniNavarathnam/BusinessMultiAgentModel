# ðŸ’¼ Business Multi-Agent Model

## Overview
This project implements a **Business Multi-Agent system** using **FastAPI** and **Streamlit**. It leverages multiple agents to understand user queries, retrieve relevant information from a vector database, and generate intelligent responses.  

### Agents
- **IntentAgent**: Determines the intent of a user query.  
- **RetrieverAgent**: Searches relevant documents from Pinecone vector database.  
- **ResponderAgent**: Generates responses using Groq LLM API.  

The system is designed to run on **AWS EC2** but can also be run locally. Streamlit provides an interactive interface for querying the model.
